# Decision record — The Office

Decisions that are not about one module and would otherwise live in a commit
message. Appended, never rewritten; a reversal gets a new entry that says so.

CapitalForge keeps one of these per module in `docs/decisions/`. The Office has
fewer and broader ones, so they share a file until that stops being true.

## 1. #16 stays unmerged until there is a Forge to ask

**Decided 2026-09-03.**

`ai-feature/pack-module-conformance` is green on six of seven jobs and red on
Smoke, and the cause is its own rules working. V32 resolves a Pack's modules
against a Forge's `_modules` manifest and V11 resolves the modules its curriculum
teaches; the smoke environment has no adapter to ask, so both report NOT_RUN,
Gate 2 blocks, and the gate-ladder checks fail against a run that stopped at
gate 2.

**Decision.** Leave #16 unmerged. Do not build a stub Forge for the smoke
environment.

A stub Forge is the same work as the real one — a dispatch map, a `_modules`
endpoint, the identity headers — and building it twice means the smoke
environment tests a fixture while the bridge stays untested. The stub Village was
worth it because the Village is a separate system The Office only reads from; a
Forge adapter is the thing the bridge exists to reach.

**What reverses it.** A CapitalForge Office adapter. That is the same item that
unblocks the Burkham Pack, `suitability_check`'s Pack declaration, and every
module registry row — so it is one build, not four.

**Rejected — merging #16 with Smoke red.** The repository has no branch
protection, so it is possible. The rules in #16 exist to stop a Pack being
validated against a Forge nobody asked, and merging them past a job saying
exactly that would be the first thing a reader cites when arguing the rule is
optional.

### Corrected 2026-09-03 — the blocker was never "no adapter"

**The CapitalForge adapter now exists, and #16 is still blocked.** Anyone reading
the entry above will expect the opposite, so the reasoning is corrected here rather
than left to mislead.

What the entry said reverses it: *"A CapitalForge Office adapter. That is the same
item that unblocks the Burkham Pack…"* That was wrong by one word. The blocker was
never **no adapter** — it was **no adapter CI can reach**.

The adapter is real, serves `_modules`, dispatches nine modules and has carried
brokered calls end to end. It runs on `127.0.0.1:4000` from a dev checkout. The
Smoke job runs on a GitHub runner with no such host, so V32 and V11 still report
NOT_RUN there, Gate 2 still blocks, and the gate-ladder checks still fail against a
run that stopped at gate 2. **Nothing about the Smoke failure has changed.**

The entry's other claim did hold: one build unblocked Gate 0, the Pack's module
reconciliation and every registry row. It unblocked everything except the thing this
entry is about.

**The decision stands, for its original reason.** #16 stays unmerged. A stub Forge
is still the same work as the real one, and the real one existing does not make a
stub in CI any less of a fixture.

### The three options, and what each actually costs

**Merge #16 with Smoke red.** Still rejected, unchanged.

**Merge #16 first, then the branch stacked on it.** The same rejection, one step
later.

**Wait until the adapter has somewhere CI can reach.** This reads as waiting and it
is not — **it is unscoped work with no owner**, and calling it waiting is how it
stays unscoped. Reaching the adapter from CI means at minimum a deployed
CapitalForge instance or a container the Smoke job can start, a reachable
`base_url` in the smoke environment's `forge_registry`, and a credential CI can
resolve — plus whatever seeded tenant data the modules need in order to answer.
None of that is estimated and none of it is assigned.

**So it is deferred indefinitely with the reason attached**, not pending. It becomes
real work the day somebody wants it, and it needs an estimate before it is
scheduled.

**What that leaves #16 as:** a branch whose rules are correct, whose failure is
those rules working, and which cannot be green in CI until the bridge has an address
in CI. It is not close to merging and should not be described as close.

## 2. `/agents/<id>` renders identifiers where labels belong — queued, not dropped

**Decided 2026-09-03.**

The Agents list was rendering the normalized `department` where the Village's
`label` belongs, so `ai_data`, `media_production` and `music_production` appeared
as headings. Fixed on the list, the filters, the roster-sync picker and the
empty-departments list.

`/agents/<id>` has the same defect and is not fixed. It renders
`identity.department` and `cert.department`, and neither payload carries a label —
so it is API plumbing on a different endpoint rather than a word swap. The
identifier smoke check does not scan that route, so nothing reports it.

**Decision.** Queued, not dropped. It is the same defect, it is still there, and
`broker/departments` states the distinction the page is on the wrong side of:
`department` is what a row is grouped and filtered by, `label` is the word an
operator reads.

**Recorded because a fix that stops at the first surface reads as a fix.** The
Agents list is right and the agent detail page is not, and the difference is
invisible to anyone who only opened the list.

**Deferred 2026-09-03**, with nine CapitalForge items - see
`docs/decisions/deferred.md` in that repository, which explains why the ten were
left as a group and what would change each answer. Deferred is not dropped: it is
written down so it is not raised again as new.
